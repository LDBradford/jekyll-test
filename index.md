## Welcome

This site exists to document and support a long-term project of Scripture memorization, public recitation, and instruction.

You’ll find written material, video projects, podcasts, events, and practical teaching—each aimed at restoring the older disciplines of memory, attention, and faithful repetition.

Use the navigation above to explore.
