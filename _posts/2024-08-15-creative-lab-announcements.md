This placeholder post highlights the creative experiments being tried on the site. Use it to log micro-animation ideas, interactive embeds, or preview snippets that deserve extra polish before they go live.

## Experiment Log

- Swap in `figure` captions with custom CSS to test responsive card layouts.
- Embed lightweight SVG animations and verify reduced motion preferences still apply.
- Prototype a new `callout` collection for promoting events or product drops.

## Call to Action

Invite team members to suggest a prompt for the next creative sprint, then snapshot their iterations here to build a shared inspiration board.
