Use this placeholder entry to keep track of how different contributors interact with the site. Outline who edited which layout, what markdown features they tried, and any pending follow-ups so the project stays coordinated.

## Session Highlights

1. Organizer updated `blog/index.md` to surface recent demos.
1. UX lead verified the `card` layout still aligns with marketing guidelines.
1. Dev confirmed the `_data/navigation.yml` entries validate for each new page.

## Next Steps

Plan for a short retrospective once all dummy posts are reviewed. Decide whether to keep this coordination post as a template or replace it with real progress notes once launch begins.
