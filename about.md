## Background

This project grew out of a sustained personal effort to memorize extended portions of Scripture—not as a novelty, but as a discipline.

What began privately has become public, as others expressed interest in both the *practice* and the *method*.

## Philosophy

Memorization is not a trick.  
It is a craft.

Like all crafts, it rewards patience, structure, and fidelity to time-tested techniques. This site favors durable methods over shortcuts and depth over speed.

## This Site

Everything here—articles, videos, podcasts, events—serves that single end: helping people internalize Scripture in a serious and sustainable way.
